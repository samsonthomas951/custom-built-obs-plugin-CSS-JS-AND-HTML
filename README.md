# Custom Built OBS Plugin - NYIMBO ZA KRISTO

This is a custom-made OBS plugin for displaying lyrics of Nyimbo Za Kristo songs. The plugin was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes 220 songs from the Seventh Day Adventist hymnal.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your computer if you have Git installed:
```bash
https://github.com/samsonthomas951/custom-built-obs-plugin-CSS-JS-AND-HTML.git
```
2. Change directories to 'Nyimbo za Kristo'. In this directory, you'll find files such as Nyimbo.html and Display2.html. Ensure that all files are in the same directory for the plugin to function correctly.
3. Copy the path to Nyimbo.html and navigate to OBS Browser > Docs > Custom Doc. Paste the path into the text field provided. This will open a control panel for the plugin.
4. Copy the path to Display2.html and paste it into the OBS Browser. Specify the dimensions of the browser window (e.g., 1365 x 300). This will display the desired lyrics on the screen. Adjust the position of the lyrics within the streaming screen as needed.

## Usage

Launch the plugin by pasting the path to your Nyimbo.html file into the custom documents section of OBS. A control panel will appear. Type the number of the song you wish to display and press Enter. Click the "Next" button to advance to the following two lines of the song, and use the "Previous" button to return to previous verses.
